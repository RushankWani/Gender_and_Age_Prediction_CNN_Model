###Age and Gender Prediction Model
This repository contains code for training a deep learning model to predict the age and gender of individuals based on facial images. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

###Import Modules
The following modules are imported for data processing, visualization, and model building:

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: for numerical computations
os: for operating system related tasks
matplotlib.pyplot: for data visualization
seaborn: for statistical data visualization
warnings: for suppressing warning messages
tqdm: for creating progress bars during data processing
tensorflow: deep learning library
keras.preprocessing.image.load_img: for loading and preprocessing images
keras.models.Sequential: for creating a sequential model
keras.layers: various types of layers used in the model
Load the Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is located in the 'UTKFace-new/UTKFace/' directory. Each image file contains the age and gender information in its filename. The code loads the images, extracts the age and gender labels from the filenames, and stores them in separate lists. These lists are then combined to create a dataframe containing the image paths, age labels, and gender labels.

###Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building the model, exploratory data analysis is performed. The first image in the dataset is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow. The age distribution is visualized using seaborn.distplot, and the gender distribution is visualized using seaborn.countplot. Additionally, a grid of 25 images with their corresponding age and gender labels is displayed.

###Feature Extraction
The images are preprocessed and resized to 128x128 pixels using the PIL library. The grayscale images are converted to numpy arrays and stored in a list. The list is then converted to a numpy array and reshaped to the appropriate input shape required by the model. The pixel values are normalized by dividing them by 255.0.

###Model Creation
The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The input shape is specified as (128, 128, 1) corresponding to the image dimensions and the grayscale channel. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, and the fully connected layers perform classification tasks.

###Training the Model
The model is compiled using the 'adam' optimizer and two loss functions: binary cross-entropy for gender prediction and mean absolute error for age prediction. The model is trained using the extracted features (X) as input and gender labels (y_gender) and age labels (y_age) as targets. The training is performed for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a validation split of 0.2.

###Plotting the Results
The training and validation losses for age prediction are plotted using matplotlib.pyplot.plot. The plot shows the trend of the loss values over the training epochs.

###Prediction with Test Data
Finally, the trained model is used to predict the gender and age of a test image ('xyz.jpeg'). The image is preprocessed and normalized similar to the training data. The model predicts the gender and age, which are then displayed along with the image using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.
